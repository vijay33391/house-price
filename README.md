# My Deployment Learning Journey — Git, Local Setup & Docker (Attempt & Failure)

This repository documents my personal learning journey where I focused on learning how to manage my machine learning projects using Git, organize code locally, and attempt Docker deployment. 

Even though my Docker deployment attempt failed, I gained very important real-world experience in managing code, understanding pipelines, and identifying challenges that occur in deployment.

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- ✅ Learn version control using Git.
- ✅ Setup and manage a clean local development environment.
- ✅ Organize machine learning projects with proper directory structure.
- ✅ Learn Docker basics and attempt to containerize my ML project.
- ❌ Successfully complete full Docker deployment (FAILED — but valuable learnings).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Git & GitHub
- Python 3.x
- Docker (learning & failed attempt)
- Flask (for API deployment experiment)
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code / Terminal
